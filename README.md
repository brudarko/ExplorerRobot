Prototype robot to find outbreaks of the mosquito that transmits infectious diseases in terrains of difficult access.
This is a prototype robot, the main idea is to make a robot more resistant parts.

# Purpose/Why?

In Brazil, the Aedes aegypti mosquito is a major transmitter of infectious diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, zika and yellow fever. As it is a domestic mosquito, it is most commonly found in areas of high urban concentration.

More than 80% of the outbreaks are found inside houses or their surroundings. Health agents are always working to decrease the number of outbreaks thus decreasing the cases of infected people as well. However, there is a problem...

In some cases, these health workers may not always be able to access some areas, perhaps because there is a lot of rubbish/garbage, or even if it is a tight space like a basement.

And that's what the robot comes in, the main purpose of the robot is to serve as a helper to monitor these areas and give feedback to the agents so that there can be a more accurate investigation of the site.

# The robot

The prototype robot is made of Lego Mindstorms.
It has 4 treadmills and two more to overlap obstacles, as well as if the robot tilts, it can return to its original position.

In this version, it is controlled via bluetooth with a reachability of 40 meters. Coupled at its top is a GoPro Hero 4 that will stream the video to the health agent, giving you the possibility to see what the robot's see.

We could use a smartphone as well.

# Future

With a more robust robot, I want to make some additions to the project, such as:
- Collect data such as temperature and humidity of the environment;
- Unify all data collected in only one interface;
- Use a better camera, with flash - or night vision;
- More data that could be helpful?

If you have any questions about this project, please do not hesitate to ask.
